# Nismara Logistics - Project Context & Rules

## 1. Project Overview

Nismara Logistics is a web platform for a virtual trucking community (VTC). It integrates with Discord (for authentication and roles) and Trucky (for in-game data, `truckyId`, `truckyRank`). The platform includes features such as a Social Gallery, Market, Fuel Market, Cargo Market, Convoy management, and a Driver directory.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict typing, interfaces/types defined inline or in models).
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router, Server Components & Server Actions).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Vanilla CSS/Tailwind without complex UI component libraries, relies on custom implementation).
- **Icons:** `lucide-react`.
- **Database (MongoDB):** MongoDB (using native `mongodb` driver). **CRITICAL:** Always use Mongo connection pooling via `clientPromise` from `@/lib/mongodb` rather than opening new connections.
- **Cache / High-Performance Store (Redis):** Uses `ioredis` (exported from `@/lib/redis`). Use Redis for high-frequency, temporary, or time-sensitive tasks (like the "Scratchers" mechanic) where MongoDB would be too slow or expensive.
- **Storage:** Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible API for all media uploads, combined with WebP compression).
- **Authentication:** NextAuth (Discord Provider).
- **Bot Protection:** Cloudflare Turnstile. Use `TurnstileWidget` (client) and `verifyTurnstileToken` (server) — see Section 11.
- **Deployment:** PM2 / Custom Node Server (via `ecosystem.config.js`).

## 3. Core Domains & Conventions

- **User Identification:** The primary identifier is usually `discordId`. Ensure database queries use `discordId` when dealing with user relations. **HOWEVER**, be extremely careful with specific collections! For example, `gallery_posts` and `gallery_comments` use `userId` (which stores the discordId), NOT `discordId`. Always verify the schema (e.g. by checking existing insertion logic) before assuming the field name is `discordId`.
- **Trucky Integration:** Users have a `truckyId` and `truckyRank`. Ensure these are passed down when rendering user profiles or comments.
- **Nismara Plus:** A premium subscription tier represented by `nismaraplus.status === true`. It provides perks like larger upload limits (5MB vs 3MB default), market discounts, GIF upload support, and a special UI badge.
- **Roles & Permissions:** Users can have `discordRole` or `role` set to `"manager"` or `"admin"`. Always check for these roles when showing destructive actions (like deleting posts).

## 4. File Upload & Storage (Cloudflare R2) Rules

- **Deferred Uploads (Client-Side):** DO NOT upload images directly to R2 on an `onChange` event in a form. Instead, store the `File` object in state (e.g., `useState<File | null>`) and show a local preview using `URL.createObjectURL()`. Only perform the actual compression and upload to R2 inside the `handleSubmit` or form `action` block when the user explicitly clicks "Save" or "Submit". This prevents ghost files if the user cancels or changes the image multiple times.
- **Image Compression & WebP Conversion:** ALL image uploads must use the existing utility at `@/lib/imageUtils` (specifically the `compressImageToWebP` function) to compress and convert files to WebP.
- **Upload Limits & Formats:**
  - **Standard Drivers:** Maximum 3MB per file. Allowed formats: PNG, JPEG, JPG. (All must be converted to WebP).
  - **Nismara+ Drivers:** Maximum 5MB per file. Allowed formats: PNG, JPEG, JPG, and **GIF**. (GIFs must **NOT** be converted to WebP; keep original).
- **Storage Hygiene:** When a user updates or replaces an existing image (e.g., changing a profile picture or gallery image), the old file **MUST** be deleted from R2 to prevent orphaned and unused files taking up space.

## 5. Economy, Currency & Penalty System

- **Currency (`currencies` collection):** Nismara Coin (NC) balances are stored here. **CRITICAL:** Every query and update **MUST** include both `userId` (discordId) and `guildId` (usually `process.env.GUILD_ID` or `"863959415702028318"`). To modify a balance, use `$inc: { totalNC: amount }`.
- **Currency History (`currencyhistories` collection):** Every time you modify `totalNC`, you **MUST** insert a log into this collection. The document must contain:
  - `userId`: The user's discordId.
  - `guildId`: The server's ID.
  - `amount`: The amount of NC added or deducted.
  - `type`: Either `"earn"` or `"spend"`.
  - `reason`: A string describing the transaction (e.g. `"Membeli Mod Market: Scania"`).
  - `createdAt`: `new Date()`.
- **Transaction History (`transactions` collection):** This is the user-facing shopping and order history (e.g. Fleet purchases, Maintenance, Market Mod buys). It is separate from `currencyhistories` which tracks raw NC mutations. When processing a user purchase, you **MUST** insert a document here with fields such as `trxId`, `discordId`, `userId`, `title`, `category` (fleet/maintenance/nismaraplus/market), `amount`, `currency` (NC/IDR), and `metadata`. Avoid creating duplicate history pages; all user purchases should be directed to the unified `/dashboard/transactions` page.
- **Penalty Points (`points` collection):** "Points" in this project strictly means **Penalty Points (Hukuman)**, not reward points. Balances are stored in `totalPoints`. Like currencies, queries **MUST** include `userId` and `guildId`. Use `$inc: { totalPoints: amount }` to modify. **CRITICAL:** Penalty points can NEVER be negative (minimum 0). Always check current balance and clamp deductions if necessary.
- **Penalty History (`pointhistories` collection):** Every time penalty points are modified, a log must be inserted containing:
  - `userId` (discordId of the penalized user) and `guildId`.
  - `managerId`: the discordId of the admin/manager applying or removing the penalty (or the user themselves if paying off a penalty).
  - `points`: The amount of points added or removed.
  - `type`: Either `"add"` (giving penalty) or `"remove"` (paying/removing penalty).
  - `reason`: String explanation.
  - `createdAt`: `new Date()`.

## 6. UI/UX & Styling Guidelines

- **Badges:** All user role, premium, and rank badges MUST be rendered using the centralized `<UserBadges />` component located at `components/icons/UserBadges.tsx`. Do not hardcode individual icons (like crowns or checkmarks) across different pages.
- **Gallery & Comments:** The gallery uses a "Threaded / Instagram Style" for comments. Comments support nested replies (1-level deep via `parentId` and `replyToUser`) and optimistic UI updates for "Likes".
- **Modern & Dynamic:** Follow the "Web Application Development" rules: use modern typography, vibrant/dark mode colors, smooth gradients, and micro-animations (e.g., hover effects, scale transforms).
- **Z-Index & Tooltips:** Use Tailwind's `group` and `group-hover` strategically to avoid stacking context issues when rendering lists of items with tooltips/badges. ALWAYS add `relative z-10 hover:z-50` to the row/card container to ensure tooltips render above subsequent rows. Furthermore, BEWARE of `line-clamp-1` or `overflow: hidden` on parent containers (like flex wrappers), as this will completely clip and hide absolute tooltips inside them. Apply text truncation strictly to inner text spans instead.
- **Destructive/Critical Actions & Alerts:** NEVER use the native browser `alert()` or `confirm()` dialogs. Instead, ALWAYS import and use `showAlert` and `showConfirm` from `@/lib/dialog`. These functions return Promises and trigger our custom global `<Modal />` component. Example usage: `await showAlert("Berhasil!")` or `if (await showConfirm("Yakin hapus?")) { ... }`. This prevents ugly browser pop-ups and avoids polluting components with manual modal state.

## 7. Data Formatting Standards
- **Timezone (WIB/Jakarta):** Always format dates and times explicitly to `Asia/Jakarta` using `toLocaleString("id-ID", { timeZone: 'Asia/Jakarta', ... })` and append " WIB" where contextually appropriate, especially on charts, feeds, and market history.
- **Currency (NC):** Always format Nismara Coin (NC) balances to standard Indonesian currency format (e.g. `2.000,00 NC`) using `.toLocaleString("id-ID", { minimumFractionDigits: 2, maximumFractionDigits: 2 })`. Do NOT use `.toFixed(2)` for frontend display of user balances.
- **Fuel (Liter):** Fuel amounts should always be displayed as flat integers without decimals (e.g. `500 L`). Use `Math.floor()` before formatting with `.toLocaleString("id-ID")`.

## 8. Domain Configuration

- **Production URL:** `https://transport.nismara.web.id`.
- **Beta URL/Preview:** `https://beta.nismara.web.id`.

## 8. Documentation & Walkthroughs

- **Convention:** Whenever creating new major features or system mechanics, agents should reference or update the documentation in this folder (e.g., `sistem-mekanik.md`, `sistem-notifikasi.md`). This acts as the project's historical log and knowledge base.

## 9. Next.js 15+ / 16 & CSS Layout Gotchas

- **searchParams (Next.js 15+):** In Server Components, `searchParams` is a Promise and **MUST** be unwrapped (e.g. `const resolvedParams = await searchParams;`) before accessing its properties (like `resolvedParams.tag`).
- **Sticky Positioning & Overflow:** NEVER use `overflow-x-hidden` on `<html>`, `<body>`, or outer layout wrappers if you intend to use `position: sticky` on descendant elements. It establishes a new block formatting context that completely breaks sticky positioning relative to the viewport. Use `overflow-x-clip` instead, which clips horizontal overflow without breaking sticky behavior.
- **Client State Re-hydration:** When a Server Component passes new props to a Client Component due to URL navigation (like changing `searchParams`), standard `useState(initialProp)` will NOT automatically update. Always use a `useEffect` to sync the state when the props change to ensure the UI reflects the new data without requiring a full manual reload.

## 10. Recent Architectural Patterns & Conventions

- **Fleet Assignment & Ownership:** When dealing with Fleet Assignments, ALWAYS use the `owner` field rather than `driver` to determine ownership. The `driver` field is maintained on the backend for legacy sync but should not be relied upon in frontend state. When rendering dropdowns to assign users (e.g. in Modals or Buy pages), NEVER use a native `<select>` due to the large number of users. Instead, use a custom searchable dropdown that allows filtering by `name`, `discordId`, and `truckyId`.
- **Ticket Auto-fill via URL:** The Ticket System (`TicketClient.tsx`) supports automatic form filling via URL parameters. When linking users to report a feature (e.g. reporting a comment), pass rich context in the URL (e.g. `?commentId=...&postId=...&reportedUser=...&commentText=...`). The TicketClient will automatically detect these, select the appropriate Category (like "Report Komentar"), and construct a detailed description payload to help Managers quickly identify the issue without manual investigation.
- **Modal vs Detail Page Consistency:** When building features that exist both on a standalone page (e.g., `PostDetailClient`) and a quick-view modal (e.g., `GalleryModal`), ensure complete feature parity. Actions like Edit, Delete, and Report must be fully synchronized and functional in both contexts with Optimistic UI updates.
- **Hybrid Session Caching:** The NextAuth `session` callback utilizes a hybrid caching strategy using Redis. Do not perform heavy MongoDB queries or external API calls (Discord, Trucky) directly inside the `session` callback on every request. Always check for a cached profile in Redis (`session:profile:${user.id}`) first. If a cache miss occurs, perform the queries and save the result to Redis with a 15-minute TTL (`900` seconds) before returning the session.
- **Session Garbage Collection:** The MongoDB `sessions` collection must have a TTL index on the `expires` field (`{ "expires": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 0 }`) to automatically delete expired sessions and prevent database bloat. Do not rely on application-level cron jobs to clean up expired NextAuth sessions.
- **Radix UI `SelectValue` Gotcha:** In this project's Shadcn/Radix `Select` component, `<SelectValue />` (without children) can render the raw `value` string instead of the selected `SelectItem`'s label text when the dropdown is closed — especially when the `value` prop is set programmatically (e.g., from `defaultValues`). **Always provide explicit label children** to `SelectValue` using a value-to-label mapping object. Example:
  ```tsx
  const LABELS = { all: "Semua Driver", nismara_plus: "Nismara+ Aktif" };
  <SelectValue>{LABELS[field.value] || "Pilih..."}</SelectValue>
  ```
  Never rely on `<SelectValue placeholder="..." />` alone to display the correct human-readable text for an already-selected value.

## 11. Cloudflare Turnstile (Bot Protection)

Turnstile is the standard bot-protection mechanism for all public-facing user submission forms (survey answers, etc.). The integration consists of two parts:

### Files
- **`lib/turnstile.ts`** — Server-side token verifier. Import and call `verifyTurnstileToken(token)` in any Server Action or API Route that needs bot protection.
- **`components/ui/TurnstileWidget.tsx`** — Client-side React widget. Renders the Cloudflare challenge inside any Client Component form.

### Environment Variables (`.env.local`)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=   # Public — used by the client widget
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=             # Secret — used ONLY on the server to verify tokens
```
Get keys from [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com) → **Turnstile** → Add Site.

### Client-Side Usage
```tsx
import TurnstileWidget from "@/components/ui/TurnstileWidget";

const [turnstileToken, setTurnstileToken] = useState<string | null>(null);

// In JSX, place above the submit button:
<TurnstileWidget
  onVerify={(token) => setTurnstileToken(token)}
  onExpire={() => setTurnstileToken(null)}
  onError={() => setTurnstileToken(null)}
  theme="auto" // or "light" | "dark"
/>

// Disable submit until verified:
<Button type="submit" disabled={!turnstileToken}>Kirim</Button>
```

### Server-Side Usage (Server Action or API Route)
```ts
import { verifyTurnstileToken } from "@/lib/turnstile";

// ALWAYS call this FIRST, before any auth check or DB operation:
const turnstileResult = await verifyTurnstileToken(data.turnstileToken);
if (!turnstileResult.success) {
  return { success: false, error: "Verifikasi keamanan gagal. Coba lagi." };
}
```

### Critical Rules
- **NEVER skip server-side verification.** The client-side token state (`turnstileToken`) is only a UX guard. The real protection is `verifyTurnstileToken()` on the server. A malicious user could bypass the client check and POST directly to the Server Action.
- **Tokens are single-use.** Each Turnstile token can only be verified once. After a successful verification, the token is consumed. If the submission fails for other reasons (e.g., duplicate response), the widget must be re-solved. The client should call `setTurnstileToken(null)` on error so the widget resets.
- **Dev mode behavior:** If `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is not set and `NODE_ENV === "development"`, `verifyTurnstileToken` skips verification and returns `{ success: true }`. This prevents blocking local development. Similarly, `TurnstileWidget` renders a placeholder when `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` is absent. **Do NOT use this behavior in production** — always set both keys in the production environment.
- **Do NOT add Turnstile to admin/manager-only forms** (e.g., survey create/edit, event management). It is only needed for driver-facing public submission forms.
- **Placement:** Always render `TurnstileWidget` **above** the submit button, after all form questions, so it's the last step before submission.

## 12. Strict Verification (No Guessing)

- **NEVER GUESS THE STRUCTURE:** Do not assume or guess the database schema, field names, or object structures.
- **ALWAYS VERIFY FIRST:** Before writing queries, aggregation pipelines, or data migration scripts, you **MUST** verify the actual structure by either reading the Mongoose models (e.g., `lib/models/`) or inspecting actual documents in the database.
- **Why?** Guessing field names (like assuming `endDate` instead of `endAt`) can cause catastrophic data inconsistencies, especially during migrations or when interacting with other services (like the Discord bot) that expect a strict schema.

## 13. Anti-Cache Standards & Invalidation (Vercel, Cloudflare & Browser)

Nismara Logistics runs on Next.js App Router hosted on Vercel with Cloudflare proxying. Because the system deals with real-time financial balances (NC), penalty points, market mod purchases, tickets, and fleet ownership, **stale cache can cause severe user panic and miscommunication**. Always adhere to these standards:

- **Server Components & Dashboard Pages:** Every dynamic or dashboard page (`app/dashboard/**/page.tsx`) must export:
  ```tsx
  export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
  export const revalidate = 0;
  export const fetchCache = "force-no-store";
  ```
- **Route Handlers / API Endpoints:** Every dynamic or mutating API (`app/api/**/route.ts`) must declare `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`, `revalidate = 0`, `fetchCache = "force-no-store"`, and return anti-cache headers in `NextResponse.json(...)`:
  ```ts
  {
    headers: {
      "Cache-Control": "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0, s-maxage=0",
      "CDN-Cache-Control": "no-store",
      "Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control": "no-store",
      "Pragma": "no-cache",
      "Expires": "0",
    }
  }
  ```
- **Client-Side Data Fetching:** When using `fetch()` in client components (`"use client"`), ALWAYS pass `{ cache: "no-store", headers: { "Pragma": "no-cache", "Cache-Control": "no-cache" } }` to prevent the browser disk cache from serving stale JSON.
- **Data Mutations & Revalidation:**
  - On the server (after POST/PUT/DELETE mutations), call `revalidatePath("/path")` for affected pages (e.g. `/dashboard/library`, `/dashboard/transactions`). *Note: `revalidatePath` targets page paths, never API URLs.*
  - On the client (after mutation succeeds in the UI), call `router.refresh()` from `next/navigation` to invalidate the Next.js in-memory Client Router Cache.
- **Global `next.config.ts` Rules:** Maintain `experimental.staleTimes.dynamic: 0` and global header rules for `/api/:path*` and `/dashboard/:path*` at all times.

## 14. Concurrency, Atomic Updates & Race Condition Prevention

In financial mutations (NC, Penalty Points), claims (monthly Nismara+ rewards, scratchers, daily bonuses), and order processing (fleet purchases, maintenance tickets), **never rely solely on in-memory validation before updates** (e.g. `if (balance >= price)` then `updateOne`). Doing so introduces Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race conditions when concurrent requests or rapid clicks occur.

- **Pola Atomic Gate:** Always bundle all eligibility conditions (e.g., `{ totalNC: { $gte: price } }` or `{ "nismaraplus.status": true, "nismaraplus.lastClaimAt": { $lte: cooldownLimit } }`) directly into the `updateOne` or `findOneAndUpdate` filter. Check `modifiedCount === 0` (or `null` result) to reject concurrent or duplicate calls immediately.
- **Pola State Locking:** For multi-step staff workflows (e.g. claiming or completing fleet/maintenance orders), atomically transition the state from initial to processing (e.g., `{ status: "claimed" }` -> `{ status: "processing" }`) using `findOneAndUpdate` before performing balance deductions or external calls.
- **Pola Rollback Komprehensif:** When an operation spans multiple collections (e.g., locking user cooldown in `users`, deducting NC in `currencies`, and adding slots in `garages`), always maintain a rollback block in `catch` to revert the gate lock if subsequent mutations fail, ensuring user cooldowns or balances are not forfeited without rewards.
- **Safe Upsert (`$setOnInsert`):** Never run `{ upsert: true }` with only incremented or partial fields on critical collections (like `garages` or `currencies`). Always supply a full schema default under `$setOnInsert` to prevent corrupt partial documents.
- **Rate Limiting Guard:** Precede sensitive mutation handlers with `checkRateLimit(discordId, key, cooldownMs)` from `@/lib/rateLimit` as an immediate UX defense against automated request floods.
- **Skill Reference:** For detailed implementation examples and templates, refer to `.agents/skills/anti-race-condition/SKILL.md`.
